# ThomasRobertMalthusPresentation
Created in 2015 my Freshman year of High School. I wanted to be different and not just do a typical PowerPoint presentation, so instead I coded this presentation. Advance to the next "slide" by pressing the "Next" button (bottom left of button works best). And see progression of growth by pressing the "Year" button.
